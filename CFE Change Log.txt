GENERAL:
Added unit cache system:
• Units now have "caches" in the global data table that store certain commands used on them:
{@attach, @tint, @scale, @animspeed, @modelswap, @play, @statbars, @adddamage, @addrange, @height, @invulnerable, @setname, @subtitle, @face, @renameall, @addbehavior, @removebehavior, @addweapon, @removeweapon, @effect}
• Added greentext, sage, and Anonymous ツ

ADDED COMMANDS:
• @subtitle _____
• @cache # - views unit's cache number and the commands inside each
• @undo # - undos a certain number of command (rebuilds the unit using cache)
• @copy +visual - the +visual parameter now copies a unit's visuals too
• gamesetup save NAME | gamesetup load NAME - allows loading and saving all units and their commands (e.g. their visual)
• gamesetup list | gamesetup remove NAME | gamesetup removeall
• toggleanon
• !xml on|off - to toggle map xml options ingame

MODIFIED COMMANDS:
• @copy +visual
